NAME
qrcode-knitting-pattern.sh -- Generates QR knitting pattern grid from text.

SYNOPSIS
./generate "I hate text shirts"

REQUIMENTS

This requires libpng (png2pnm and pnm2png), netbmtools (pnmtoolnames) 
and qrencode which generates the images. It can be found from: 
http://fukuchi.org/works/qrencode/index.html.en
if your distribution doesn't ship as package.

DESCRIPTION

qrcode-knitting-pattern.sh passes given parameters to qrencode. 
The patterns are generated on four different error correction levels. 
Error correction in accending order: Low, Med, Q, High These come from qrencode.

All four patterns are given as possibility to select best one for your needs.


Size of the pattern changes by the length of error correction level and text 
size. The white area outside of pattern is also required for image to be 
recognized.

Non ASCII characters don't work. (1)

The pattern isn't checked. Smartphones have software to scan QR-codes often. 
So you can try to check the output with that.
And sad news to Microsoft Windows users. This doesn't work for you. Only in 
enviroments where is bash and other tools. (2)

LAUNDRY TAG

If you haven't understood anything ask your (UNIX) geek friend if he could 
print the pattern of your choise.

(1) Tested only with zbarimg. Maybe something else can understand.
(2) Installing cygwin and all required tools, qrencode, I don't see reason why 
    not this script wouldn't run. No support for that provided.

NO WARRANTY and USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. DON'T TRUST MY SCRIPTING SKILLS
